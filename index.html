        <h1>Switchboard for BGI</h1>
        <p><a href="http:/switchboardhq.com" target="_blank">Switchboard</a> is web-based software designed for communities of people (like schools or alumni groups) to post asks or offers for jobs, internships, mentorship, hospitality, goods or services. Kind of like craigslist, but beautifully crafted and just for our community. This simple structure keeps the content actionable and focused.</p>

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <a id="get_access"></a>
        <h4>How do BGIers get access?</h4>
        <p><a href="https://bgi.switchboardhq.com/" target="_blank">Our own switchboard website</a> has already been set up. Anyone in the world can see post titles from the site homepage. Accessing any of the other features, like seeing actual post content, sharing posts, searching/filtering results etc requires a account on the site. Creating an account requires a name, email address and knowing the super secret passphrase that everyone affiliated with BGI should know (q: “What is BGI co-founder Elizabeth Pinchot's nickname?”).</p>
        <a id="login"></a>
        <h4>Can’t I just log-in with my bgi/Facebook/Twitter/myspace/google account info?</h4>
        <p>No, not at this time. You must create a new account on the BGI Switchboard site. But don’t worry! It’s painless! Suck it up... all you need is your email address.
        Is there really a need for this and won’t it be hard to get the community to post the kind of content that Switchboard thrives on?
        The community is already doing it. BGI Facebook Group activity from the start of 2013 was analyzed and categorized to see how much of the current conversations could have been “Switchboardable”. Across all groups, 53% of all content is clearly an “ask” or an “offer” and fits well with Switchboard. <a href="http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/bgi_facebook_data/BGIFacebookGroupActivitySummary?:embed=y&:display_count=no">Take a look at the analysis</a> for more info.</p>

        <a id="why_post"></a>
        <h4>Why should I post something to Switchboard instead of just posting it to [insert your favorite other social media site here]?</h4>
        <p>Facebook, LinkedIn Groups, and the BGI Commons play a vital role for the community for sharing information and facilitating conversations about topics the community cares about. Switchboard is not meant to replace these tools, but to compliment them.</p>
        <p>Switchboard’s specialty is actionable content. It’s sole purpose is to connect us with opportunities and each other with as little friction as possible. It’s not cluttered with cat videos, or even links to amazing articles you think you’ll read someday. Switchboard reduces the “noise” that comes with other social sites like Facebook and lets us get down to business.</p>
        <p>This except from a recent Switchboard blog post sums it up nicely:</p>
        <blockquote>[...] on Switchboard, your profile is your past post history and nothing more—no likes, no followers. Check my profile and you might find that I posted an offer to host people in Maine, or that I asked for advice about finding a job at the Spacing Guild. The only potential action you can perform in response to my profile is contacting me to fulfill my ask or take me up on my offer. There is no intermediate “like” or “follow.” Switchboard is useful. Human. You are not directed to interact with my online persona, you are directed to interact with me.</blockquote>
        <p>If everyone posts to Switchboard first as the central hub for asks and offers and then broadcasts from there, the likelihood of a success increases dramatically because everyone knows where to go for this type of content in the community.</p>
        <p>Plus, you can easily link your Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter accounts and cross post to those sites right from your Switchboard post with a couple clicks.</p> 

        <a id="switchboard_ends"></a>
        <h4>What happens to our Switchboard if the Switchboard company goes out of business?</h4>
        <p>Then in all likelihood our Switchboard would go away. The same is true of Facebook, linkedin, or any other service BGI uses that we don’t directly control. But fear not! While of course it would be sad if BGI’s thriving switchboard was discontinued because the larger company failed, keep in mind that the nature of the content that goes on Switchboard is short lived and serves an immediate need. Someone posts about a job opening, and the job gets filled. Someone asks for a place to stay in Seattle, and they find it. Switchboard does not need to live forever for it to be useful to the community. And if we end up finding it so useful, it seems likely we would find another way to serve the needs of the community.

        <a id="costs"></a>
        <h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
        <p>Switchboard is a software-as-service offered by the startup Weathergram in Portland. It started with Reed College in Portland as a side project and is now part of the Portland Incubator Project at Wieden+Kennedy, trying to make it as a business. There are two pricing plans:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Someone in the community sponsors the site for $5000 a year. There is no cost for members. Comes with some additional moderator privileges, analytics and reports.</li>
        <li>Nominal $35/month subscription covered by a sponsor to get the site up (like the Alumni Association?), then also individual members can pay $5/year in order to see more than 20 posts. Once some % of all members are paying, the monthly fee is waived.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All hosting, maintenance, support and updates are covered.</p>

        <a id="alumni_board_help"></a>
        <h4>What can the Alumni Board do to help?</h4>
        <p>It would be great if 1 or more board members was part of the initial core group of testers and evangelists. Ideally these people can be available on a daily basis to scan the site for new posts and cultivate the conversations and make connections.
        Once the site has some activity, the alumni board can promote the site through the newsletter and generally drive members to the site as much as possible, using whatever means it feels is appropriate.</p>
        <p>The Board can also help legitimize the initiative with BGI proper.</p>
        
        <a id="bgi_help"></a>
        <h4>What can BGI do to help?</h4>
        <p>It would be great if someone from BGI (ideally someone with a good pulse on alumni and current student activities) could be actively involved in the initial testing. Ideally it would be part of someone’s job description to help make Switchboard useful for members.  This person would socialize Switchboard with BGI faculty and staff and help make connections between current students and alumni.</p>
        <p>BGI could also step up and financially sponsor the site so that members don’t have to pay.</p>

        <a id="launch_plan"></a>
        <h4>Ok, so what’s the plan for getting this thing launched?</h4>
        <h5>1) Start with a core group and seed Switchboard</h5>
        <p>The worst thing for selling this to new members is to have them show up to an empty room. Before the site is broadcast in any major way we need to have a core set of early adopters actively using the site. </p>
        <p>But how do we find our first users? One approach would be to identify specific people that are frequent posters and commenters on BGI Facebook groups and the Commons. But this seems a bit laborious. </p>
        <p>My suggested approach is to post to Facebook and the Commons an ask for people who are interested in being involved with beta testing Switchboard and let this initial group self-select. We could use this group to get general feedback about the viability of Switchboard at BGI and also as “manual” labor in pulling posts from other sources into switchboard, as well as building momentum in the community.</p>
        <h6>Action items:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a version of this document as an orientation/pitch for first users</li>
          <li>Draft the language for the initial recruitment requests</li>
          <li>Host a call with the core group to demo/discuss switchboard</li>
          <li>Get them to start posting and commenting</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>2) Broadcast each post</h5>
        <p>Every new post should get cross-posted to at least Facebook and Twitter. And ideally the Twitter feed would get pulled into the commons as well using the Twitter widget. Our strategy should always be to “switchboard it”, and then broadcast posts to other platforms so that members see posts. But to access the content and connect with each other, we want them to come back to the BGI Switchboard.</p>
        <h6>Action items:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strike>Setup a BGI Switchboard Twitter account</strike> <a href="https://twitter.com/bgiswitchboard" target="_blank">@bgiswitchboard</a></li>
          <li>Determine who is authorized to post to the account and setup link in Switchboard</li>
          <li>Agree on format for tweets</li>
          <li>Embed twitter feed in the Commons</li>
          <li>Assign someone to cross post items as appropriate to the Commons</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>3) Actively cultivate conversations</h5>
        <p>It takes faith and courage to post on Switchboard, especially an ask. Every comment builds goodwill and makes our members feel heard and acknowledged. So these initial core users should strive to make sure there is at least one comment on every post. </p>
        <p>There are four comment archetypes. One: “Thanks for posting, we’ll get the word out!” Two: “Try going to [X resource that poster didn’t know about], I know that they can help you.” Three: “I have a friend [who has a friend] who can help you. Message me for information.” Four: “Have you seen [link to older post that contains exactly what the poster was looking for]?”</p>
        <h6>Action items:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify several people who have bandwidth to monitor switchboard for new posts and make replies and connections, especially at the beginning</li>
          <li>Identify the resources these managers can access to better assist in making connections</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>4) Promote Switchboard at an upcoming intensive</h5>
        <p>Current students are the the most energized about the connections BGI can provide because they are closest to it. Most alumni don’t live and breathe BGI on a daily basis, so it is further from their minds. We need current student engagement for Switchboard to thrive.</p>
        <p>Let’s find 2-3 passionate students to champion switchboard “on campus”. They would show students the site (already being used by the core group so that it’s not an empty room), hand out business cards or other promotional content, and build a buzz around it. These student champions could also take on some of the manual work to cultivate the online switchboard, as well as acting as manual switchboard to have a pulse on how to fulfill asks and offers by connecting people together. </p>
        <h6>Action items:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Determine which intensive or events are appropriate</li>
          <li>Design and print business cards</li>
          <li>Make it so!</li>
        </ul>
